# Product-Sales-Analysis
### Problem Statement
Management requires a dashboard to evaluate product performance across different regions, timeframes and discount bands. The goal is to:

-Identify top-performing regions by revenue.

-Analyze revenue trends over time.

-Assess the impact of discount strategies on revenue and profit.

-Provide an dashboard for data-driven decision-making

### Data Sources
-product_data.csv - Contains product details such as category, price and other product attributes.

-discount_data.csv - Details discount bands and discount percentages applied across different months.

-products_sales.csv - Includes transactional sales data, revenue and profit information.

### KPIs
-Revenue by Country: Identifying top-performing regions.

-Revenue by Date & Year: Analyzing comparative trends over time.

-Revenue by Discount Band: Evaluating how discounts influence revenue generation.

-Profitability Analysis: Examining profit margins across different categories and regions.

-Detailed Table View: Providing a  revenue-profit breakdown by country and year.

### Tools
-SQL (MS SQL Server): Data extraction, transformation and querying (CTEs, Joins, Aggregations).

-Power BI: Data transformation (Power Query) and visualization (dashboard creation).

### Data Cleaning 
-Checking for missing values, duplicates and inconsistencies.

-Changing the date formats.

-Using SQL joins to merge datasets and create structured tables for analysis

### Exploratory Data Analysis
-Performed to check for trends before computing the KPIs. Perform analysis on the following questions;

-How is the distribution of revenue by region?

-Are there trends in revenue by date and year?

-What is the impact of discount bands on revenue and profit?

### Data Analysis
-Using SQL, structured datasets were prepared and transferred to Power BI for deeper insights. The pre-defined KPIs were then calculated and analyzed based on the  EDA findings and the KPIs
